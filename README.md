## Install Guide

<h3> Install this on a barebones Arch Linux installation </h3>

```shell
pacman -Sy git
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AegisCat/dotfiles-hyprland-arch.git ~/dotfiles-hyprland-arch
cd ~/dotfiles-hyprland-arch-2/Scripts
./install.sh
```

## Reason behind the new repo
I wanted to keep the old setup archived as a lot has changed since that I thought it would be better to start over rather than fix everything ontop of the old one,

## Credits

These dots were built upon [prasanthrangan's](https://github.com/prasanthrangan)
work. I also may have butchered it by targetting only Catppuccin Mocha
